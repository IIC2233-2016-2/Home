The Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC), a member of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Group, is a multilateral organization based in Washington, D.C., that is committed to the development of Latin America and the Caribbean through the private sector.  As part of its mission, the IIC supports the private sector and state-owned enterprises through financing in the form of loans, equity investments, and guarantees. The IIC also partners with clients to provide advisory and training services.  In January 2016, the IDB Group consolidated its private sector operations in the IIC to better serve the region, clients and partners, and to maximize its development impact. The consolidated IIC offers the full array of private sector products and services previously offered across the IDB Group.
